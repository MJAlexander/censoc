# Introduction
The CenSoc dataset contains information about individaul's birth date (and implied at the 1940 census), death date and state of residence in 1940. The dataset does not contain any other information on the characteristics of the individuals; however, by using the unique identifier information contained in the CenSoc dataset, the data can be merged back to the 1940 census available on the [IPUMS-USA](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/) website. 

This document briefly outlines how to obtain data from the 1940 full count census, which is publicly available through IPUMS. Once obtained, the IPUMS data can be merged with the CenSoc dataset. This step is explained in the final section. 

If you already have an IPUMS account and are familar with obtaining data from IPUMS, it may be more useful to head straight to the last section for details on how to merge. However, please note the section on 'Variables required for the CenSoc merge'. 

# Registering for IPUMS
The Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) is a collection of individual-level data sources. IPUMS consists of microdata samples from censuses and surveys, in both the USA and internationally. IPUMS is housed at the Minnesota Population Center at the University of Minnesota. 

The IPUMS-USA data collection is free to use, but researchers must register and agree to terms and conditions. All you need to do to register is to fill out the form here:

https://uma.pop.umn.edu/usa/user/new?return_url=https%3A%2F%2Fusa.ipums.org%2Fusa-action%2Fmenu

(Note: this link was accessed in March 2018. If it is broken, go to https://usa.ipums.org/usa/, navigate to 'Login' and then 'Create an account'). 

# Choosing variables from the 1940 full count census
Once you have an account, you are ready to select and download data from the 1940 full count census. To get started, go to https://usa.ipums.org/usa/ and under 'CREATE YOUR CUSTOM DATA SET' click the 'GET DATA' button. 

## Select data sample
To restrict data extraction to the 1940 full count:

- Click the 'SELECT SAMPLES BUTTON'. This will take you to a page with all possible census and ACS data that are available. 
- Uncheck the 'Default sample from each year' box
- Click the 'USA FULL COUNT' tab
- Check the 1940 100% box
- Click 'SUBMIT SAMPLE SELECTIONS' button

This will take you back to the variable selection page. 

## Variables required for CenSoc merge
There is only one technical variable required for the CenSoc merge. This is: 

- `HISTID`: a consistent individual-level identifier. 


This variable is a unique identifier that allows correspondence across the two datasets. Additionally, the `SEX` variable is needed in order to restrict the sample to be males only.  
To obtain these variables:

1. From the PERSON drop down, select 'HISTORICAL TECHNICAL'. Note that `HISTID` should be `[preselected]`, but you can click on the cross next to it just to make sure. 
2. From the PERSON drop down, select 'DEMOGRAPHIC'. Then click on the cross next to `SEX`. 

Additionally, you may want to select `AGE` from PERSON &rarr; DEMOGRAPHIC. This is not required, but this variable should be equal to the `census_age` variable in CenSoc. 

## Other variables of interest

Now that you have variables required to merge the two datasets, you can choose other variables that you may be interested in studying mortality differences by. For example, you could select `RACE`, which is under PERSONAL &rarr; RACE, ETHNICITY, AND NATIVITY. 

__NOTE:__ the size of full count census data files is quite large, so you may want to restrict the addition of extra variables accordingly. For example, a file (containing males only) with `RACE` as an additional variable is around 6.6GB. 

## Restrict to males only
The CenSoc dataset only contains males, and given the large file size of the full count census, it is wise to restrict the data to only include males before you download it. To do this:

1. Click 'VIEW CART'
2. Check that all the variables of interest are selected. Then click 'CREATE DATA EXTRACT'
3. Under OPTIONS, click the 'SELECT CASES' button
4. Check the box next to SEX
5. Check the box next to '1 Males' and click SUBMIT

# Downloading the IPUMS file

To work with IPUMS data in `R`, it is usually easiest to download the data as a CSV file. To do this, on the EXTRACT REQUEST page, next to 'DATA FORMAT' click Change, select 'Comma delimited (.csv)' and click the submit button. Note that you can work with other formats in `R` as well, but CSV is generally the easiest. The only downside is that variable values are still listed in code format, and need to be converted to meaningful values using the codebook. 

Once you are happy with your dataset, click the 'SUBMIT EXTRACT' button. Because it is full count data, you will need agree to special usage terms. Click Ok, and the dataset will begin to be extracted. 

Given the size of the file, the processing may take several hours. Once the file is ready, you will receive an email from IPUMS, and you can follow the links to download the resulting dataset. As all IPUMS datasets come compressed, the data needs to be uncompressed before it can be used. For more information on IPUMS extracts, please see [IPUMS-USA](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/data.shtml/). 

# Merging IPUMS with CenSoc

Once the IPUMS census dataset is obtained, it can easily be merged with the CenSoc dataset. The unique ID `HISTID` is available in the CenSoc and IPUMS census dataset and can be used to merge the two datasets. More complete instructions can be found [here](https://censoc.demog.berkeley.edu/articles/ipums_merge.html).
