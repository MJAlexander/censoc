## February 1, 2019

### Censoc File 
- A revised V2 of the CenSoc file is available
- A new `HISTID` variable has been added to simplify merge with the IPUMS 1940 Census data
- CenSoc V2 can be merged one-to-one on `HISTID` with the public IPUMS 1940 Full Count Census File
- 1,132 recrds were dropped from the original CenSoc V1 as they couldn't be matched on the `HISTID` variable to the IPUMS 1940 Full Count Census data. 
- For IPUMS extracts made after January 31st, 2019, an additional 39 records in the CenSoc V2 can't be matched onto the IPUMS 1940 Full Count File. These 39 records are still included in CenSoc V2.
