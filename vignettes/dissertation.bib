We show that P-splines provide a common approach to these problems. We set out a simple nonparametric strategy for the choice of the P-spline parameters (the number of knots, the degree of the P-spline, and the order of the penalty) and use mixed model (REML) methods for smoothing parameter selection. We give an example of a model in each of the three classes and analyse appropriate data sets. },

@article{leecarter1992,
	Abstract = {Time series methods are used to make long-run forecasts, with confidence intervals, of age-specific mortality in the United States from 1990 to 2065. First, the logs of the age-specific death rates are modeled as a linear function of an unobserved period-specific intensity index, with parameters depending on age. This model is fit to the matrix of U.S. death rates, 1933 to 1987, using the singular value decomposition (SVD) method; it accounts for almost all the variance over time in age-specific death rates as a group. Whereas e<sub>0</sub> has risen at a decreasing rate over the century and has decreasing variability, k(t) declines at a roughly constant rate and has roughly constant variability, facilitating forecasting. k(t), which indexes the intensity of mortality, is next modeled as a time series (specifically, a random walk with drift) and forecast. The method performs very well on within-sample forecasts, and the forecasts are insensitive to reductions in the length of the base period from 90 to 30 years; some instability appears for base periods of 10 or 20 years, however. Forecasts of age-specific rates are derived from the forecasts of k, and other life table variables are derived and presented. These imply an increase of 10.5 years in life expectancy to 86.05 in 2065 (sexes combined), with a confidence band of plus 3.9 or minus 5.6 years, including uncertainty concerning the estimated trend. Whereas 46% now survive to age 80, by 2065 46% will survive to age 90. Of the gains forecast for person-years lived over the life cycle from now until 2065, 74% will occur at age 65 and over. These life expectancy forecasts are substantially lower than direct time series forecasts of e<sub>0</sub>, and have far narrower confidence bands; however, they are substantially higher than the forecasts of the Social Security Administration's Office of the Actuary.},

	Abstract = {Projections of countries' future populations, broken down by age and sex, are widely used for planning and research. They are mostly done deterministically, but there is a widespread need for probabilistic projections. We propose a Bayesian method for probabilistic population projections for all countries. The total fertility rate and female and male life expectancies at birth are projected probabilistically using Bayesian hierarchical models estimated via Markov chain Monte Carlo using United Nations population data for all countries. These are then converted to age-specific rates and combined with a cohort component projection model. This yields probabilistic projections of any population quantity of interest. The method is illustrated for five countries of different demographic stages, continents and sizes. The method is validated by an out of sample experiment in which data from 1950--1990 are used for estimation, and applied to predict 1990--2010. The method appears reasonably accurate and well calibrated for this period. The results suggest that the current United Nations high and low variants greatly underestimate uncertainty about the number of oldest old from about 2050 and that they underestimate uncertainty for high fertility countries and overstate uncertainty for countries that have completed the demographic transition and whose fertility has started to recover towards replacement level, mostly in Europe. The results also indicate that the potential support ratio (persons aged 20--64 per person aged 65+) will almost certainly decline dramatically in most countries over the coming decades.},

In particular, the Lee-Carter model has become widely used and there have been various extensions and modifications proposed to attain a broader interpretation and to capture the main features of the dynamics of the mortality intensity. Hyndman-Ullah show a particular version of the Lee-Carter methodology, the so-called Functional Demographic Model, which is one of the most accurate approaches as regards some mortality data, particularly for longer forecast horizons where the benefit of a damped trend forecast is greater. The paper objective is properly to single out the most suitable model between the basic Lee-Carter and the Functional Demographic Model to the Italian mortality data. A comparative assessment is made and the empirical results are presented using a range of graphical analyses.},

@article{alkemamon2012,
	Abstract = {Background: Millennium Development Goal 4 calls for a reduction in the under-5 mortality rate (U5MR) by two-thirds between 1990 and 2015. Due to issues with data quality and quantity, there is uncertainty about how much progress has been made in many countries, and conflicting estimates of the overall levels and rate of decline have been reported. Consequently, there is a clear and urgent need to validate estimates, but consensus guidelines for model validation are lacking. Methods: We propose a validation method, based on the question: If current U5MR estimation methodology had been used in the past, using all available data available at that time, how accurate would the U5MR estimates and uncertainty intervals have been?Findings: Validation of the estimates and uncertainty intervals reported in 2010 by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation showed that estimates of both the past absolute levels and the rate of decline in under-5 mortality between 1990 and 2000 would have changed significantly between 2004 and 2010 for many countries, with the inclusion of additional data. For high-mortality countries in particular, over 40\% of the updated estimates for the U5MR in 2000 fell outside previously constructed 95\% uncertainty intervals, and the absolute change in the estimated rate of decline was more than 1\% for about three out of five countries.Interpretation: In light of evaluating Millennium Development Goal 4 in 2015, we hope that extensive model validation exercises will become standard practice for validating the accuracy of under-5 estimates and uncertainty intervals. Ultimately the goal of including appropriate validation methods is to improve the reliability of both estimates and uncertainty intervals, which will allow for a more fully informed assessment of both the absolute levels of, and rates of change in, the under-5 mortality rate.},
