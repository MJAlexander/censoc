# censoc
An R package for working with CenSoc dataset. 

# Introduction
The 'CenSoc' project involves producing a dataset which contains records from the full-count 1940 US census to the social security deaths masterfile. The resulting CenSoc dataset provides researchers with a tool for studying mortality inequalities in the US and how conditions have changed over time.

In addition, this repository contains documentation outlining data sources and the matching process.
